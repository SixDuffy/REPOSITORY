Gifts of roses, hand there are lingering fragrance. Sow nothing, reap nothing. Study for the purpose of application. I can give myself a
different way of learning. If I can learn something through an interest and develop myself habits, that's really nice. It 'll only take me a minute with writting it down. In this way, not only do I learn both knowledges at the same time, but also give others the reference
and encouragement. One day I'll suddenly discovered that has done so much, although it may be a little bit wrose in the view of professional. That's how surprises come to me. Rome was not built in a day, and encourage myself.
